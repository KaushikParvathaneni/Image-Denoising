# Image Denoising

My project is centered on the development and implementation of a sophisticated deep learning model specifically designed for image denoising. By harnessing the capabilities of a multi-wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN), my goal is to effectively distinguish and mitigate various forms of noise from images while striving to preserve essential details such as edges and textures. This approach not only aims to enhance the visual clarity of images but also seeks to maintain the integrity of original content, which is crucial for applications in fields like medical imaging, remote sensing, and digital photography. Utilizing advanced neural network architectures and leveraging the power of modern GPUs, the project aims to push the boundaries of what is currently achievable in image denoising technology, addressing both the high computational demands and the challenges associated with high-frequency component preservation in the denoising process.
